Codependium

Codependium is a social bookmarking tool for web developers. Users can login to save links to resources in various categories, including:

CSS
HTML
JavaScript
Job Boards
Angular
Ruby
Databases
...And More!

Users can also visit each category to view links saved by the entire Codependium community. The site also allows bookmarks to be ranked (through up-vote and down-vote) to determine the best resources available to developers looking to expand their knowledge base.

Motivation

Any developer can tell you that technology is always changing, and a life-long commitment to learning is key to success. We wanted to provide the community a way to effectively save and organize technology resources. It was also important to us that we provide a social aspect that would allow users to share links, explore technologies and easily find new resources with the click of a button.
